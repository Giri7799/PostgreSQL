1)What is MVCC in PostgreSQL
MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) in PostgreSQL is the mechanism that allows multiple transactions to run simultaneously without blocking each other, while still ensuring data consistency and integrity. 
It achieves this by keeping multiple versions of rows and letting each transaction see a snapshot of the database as of its start time.

2)What is ctid in PostgreSQL
Ctid=current tuple ID
In PostgreSQL, ctid is a system column that uniquely identifies the physical location of a row within a table. 
It consists of a tuple (page_id, row_id) where the first number is the block (page) number on disk and the second is the row’s position within that page.

3)How to update statistics in PostgreSQL?
Updated statistics are essential for query optimization because the planner relies on the table and index statistics for the best execution plan.
- ANALYZE → updates statistics only.
- VACUUM ANALYZE → cleans dead tuples + updates statistics.
- Autovacuum → automatic background updates.
- ALTER TABLE … SET STATISTICS → fine-tune per column.
- pg_stats and pg_stats_all_tables→ view collected statistics.

4)What are the indexes available in PostgreSQL
5)What is Gist and spgist indexes
6)What is a B-Tree index

7)Replication types in PostgreSQL?
- Physical Replication → WAL-level, full cluster copy (streaming, synchronous, asynchronous).
- Logical Replication → Table-level, selective, flexible (publish/subscribe).
- Snapshot Replication → Initial data copy.
- Cascading Replication → Standby-to-standby replication.

8)Replication data types in PostgreSQL
- Physical replication → WAL-level, binary data blocks.
- Logical replication → Row-level, SQL operations.
- Snapshot replication → Initial bulk data copy.
- Cascading replication → Standby-to-standby WAL forwarding.

9) How to implement clustering in PostgreSQL?

10)What are the architectural differences between SQL and PostgreSQL servers?
- SQL Server is a proprietary RDBMS from Microsoft with a tightly integrated ecosystem (Windows, .NET, Azure).
- PostgreSQL is an open‑source RDBMS with an extensible architecture, supporting custom data types, functions, and advanced features like MVCC.
- SQL Server emphasizes enterprise integration and tooling, while PostgreSQL emphasizes standards compliance, flexibility, and cross‑platform portability

12)What is an Autovacuum in PostgreSQL?
   Autovacuum is PostgreSQL’s background process that automatically runs VACUUM and ANALYZE to clean dead tuples, prevent bloat, and keep planner statistics up to date
13)How to rebuild indexes in the PostgreSQL server?
14)Have you worked on clusters
15)Which tools have used for connecting postgresql server?
   --command line
   --pgadmin
   --Visual Studio Code
16)What are the main advantages of using the PostgreSQL server? I mean, why lot of customers moving to postgresql server?
