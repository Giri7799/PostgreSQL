1) What is MVCC in PostgreSQL
MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) in PostgreSQL is the mechanism that allows multiple transactions to run simultaneously without blocking each other, while still ensuring data consistency and integrity. 
It achieves this by keeping multiple versions of rows and letting each transaction see a snapshot of the database as of its start time.

2) What is ctid in PostgreSQL
Ctid=current tuple ID
In PostgreSQL, ctid is a system column that uniquely identifies the physical location of a row within a table. 
It consists of a tuple (page_id, row_id) where the first number is the block (page) number on disk and the second is the row’s position within that page.

3) How to update statistics in PostgreSQL?
Updated statistics are essential for query optimization because the planner relies on the table and index statistics for the best execution plan.
- ANALYZE → updates statistics only.
- VACUUM ANALYZE → cleans dead tuples + updates statistics.
- Autovacuum → automatic background updates.
- ALTER TABLE … SET STATISTICS → fine-tune per column.
- pg_stats and pg_stats_all_tables→ view collected statistics.

4) What are the indexes available in PostgreSQL
   >B-tree--equality & range queries
   >Hash- equality only
   >GIN 
   >GIST
   >SP-GIST
   >BRIN
   >expression
5) What are Gist and spgist indexes?
GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned GiST) are advanced index types designed for complex data structures. 
GiST is highly flexible and supports things like ranges, geometric data, and full-text search, while SP-GiST is optimized for partitioned data structures.

6) What is a B-Tree index
The B-tree(Balanced tree) index is the default index and most commonly used index type. its a self-balancing tree structure that keeps data sorted, allowing fast lookups, inserts, deletes, and range queries.

7) Replication types in PostgreSQL?
- Physical Replication → WAL-level, full cluster copy (streaming, synchronous, asynchronous).
- Logical Replication → Table-level, selective, flexible (publish/subscribe).
- Snapshot Replication → Initial data copy.
- Cascading Replication → Standby-to-standby replication.

8) Replication data types in PostgreSQL
- Physical replication → WAL-level, binary data blocks.
- Logical replication → Row-level, SQL operations.
- Snapshot replication → Initial bulk data copy.
- Cascading replication → Standby-to-standby WAL forwarding.

9) How to implement clustering in PostgreSQL?

10) What are the architectural differences between SQL and PostgreSQL servers?
- SQL Server is a proprietary RDBMS from Microsoft with a tightly integrated ecosystem (Windows, .NET, Azure).
- PostgreSQL is an open‑source RDBMS with an extensible architecture, supporting custom data types, functions, and advanced features like MVCC.
- SQL Server emphasizes enterprise integration and tooling, while PostgreSQL emphasizes standards compliance, flexibility, and cross‑platform portability

12) What is an Autovacuum in PostgreSQL?
Autovacuum is PostgreSQL’s background process that automatically runs VACUUM and ANALYZE to clean dead tuples, prevent bloat, and keep planner statistics up to date

13) How to rebuild indexes in the PostgreSQL server?
Using the reindex command, we can rebuild the index on a single index, all indexes on a table, all indexes in a schema, or the entire database.

14) Have you worked on clusters
15) Which tools have used for connecting postgresql server?
   --command line
   --pgadmin
   --Visual Studio Code
16) What are the main advantages of using the PostgreSQL server? Why are a lot of customers moving to the PostgreSQL server?
PostgreSQL is gaining massive adoption because it combines enterprise-grade reliability, advanced features, and cost efficiency in a fully open-source package. 
Customers are moving to PostgreSQL to reduce licensing costs, gain flexibility, and leverage its strong performance, extensibility, and cloud-native support.
  --Open Source with No Licensing Costs
  --Rich Feature Set
  --Performance & Scalability
  --Strong Community & Ecosystem
  --Cloud & Container Friendly

25) Have you worked on postgresql AWS RDS instance? Then tell me the environment.
"Yes, I have worked on AWS RDS. Our environment was deployed in a Multi-AZ setup for high availability, with read replicas to handle reporting queries. 
We enabled automated backups with point-in-time recovery, and used CloudWatch and Performance Insights for monitoring and tuning. 
Security was enforced through parameter groups, encryption, and restricted security groups. 
For migrations, we used pg_dump/pg_restore and AWS DMS, and regularly tested failover scenarios to ensure resilience."

26) Have you done performance tuning in postgresql, how you done tell me the steps

27) Difference between vacuum and vacuum full?
   - VACUUM = lightweight cleanup, keeps performance stable. 
   - VACUUM FULL = heavy operation, reclaims disk space, but locks tables.
We use VACUUM FULL only when a table has had massive deletions, and we need to reclaim disk space. 
Since it locks the table and rewrites it, we schedule it during maintenance windows to avoid downtime.

36) Write the differences between vacuum and vacuumfull?
Vacuum removes dead tuples and updates statistics without locking tables, while vacuum full rewrites the entire table to reclaim disk space. but requires an exclusive lock and can block queries. 

37) why vacuum full not performed in production?
VACUUM FULL is not typically performed in production because it requires an exclusive lock on the table and rewrites the entire file, which can cause downtime and heavy I/O load. 
Instead, we rely on autovacuum for routine cleanup, and if we need to reclaim disk space, we use tools like pg_repack that achieve similar results without blocking queries.

39) write command for backup in schema level and table level?
40) What backup strategy is used?
41) What are the steps in creating replication?

42) Authentication types?
PostgreSQL supports multiple authentication methods, ranging from simple trust-based access to advanced Kerberos/GSSAPI integration. 
The choice depends on your environment (development, production, cloud, enterprise security). 
The most common are password-based (md5, scram-sha-256), trust, and host-based authentication via pg_hba.conf.
