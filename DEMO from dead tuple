Dead tuples in PostgreSQL are row versions that are no longer visible to any active transaction because they’ve been updated or deleted. 
They remain in the table until cleaned up by the VACUUM process, which reclaims the space and prevents performance degradation.
What Exactly Are Dead Tuples?
- PostgreSQL uses MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) to manage concurrent transactions.
- When a row is updated or deleted, PostgreSQL doesn’t immediately remove it:
- The old version of the row becomes a dead tuple.
- A new version (for updates) or a deletion marker (for deletes) is created.
- Dead tuples are invisible to new transactions but still occupy disk space until cleaned.
--hands-on demo execute below querys in step by step
--create table 
CREATE TABLE demo_dead_tuples (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);
--insert data
INSERT INTO demo_dead_tuples (name)
VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob'), ('Charlie'), ('David'), ('Eve');
--select data from table 
SELECT * FROM demo_dead_tuples;

--now update/delete the rows in table  
UPDATE demo_dead_tuples SET name = 'Alice_updated' WHERE name = 'Alice';
DELETE FROM demo_dead_tuples WHERE name = 'Charlie';

--run below query to check the number of dead tuples on the table.
--n_live_tup live rows visible to queries
--n_dead_tup dead tuples waiting for cleanup
SELECT relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'demo_dead_tuples';

--to clear the dead tuples run vacuum
VACUUM demo_dead_tuples;

--now check dead tuples
SELECT relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'demo_dead_tuples';

--also, you can use the vacuum full 
VACUUM FULL demo_dead_tuples;
